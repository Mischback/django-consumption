This directory contains the app's specific static frontend assets, like script
files, stylesheets and images.

Please note, that some of these assets (e.g. stylesheets) are generated by
specific frontend tools. This generation is part of the app's build process
while creating the actual PyPI package. Generated assets are **not** included
in version control. Their source (see ``consumption/static/_src``) **is**
included in version control.
